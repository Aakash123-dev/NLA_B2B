Here's a breakdown:\n\n‚Ä¢ Weekday vs Weekend: Increase prices by 8% during peak weekend hours\n‚Ä¢ Competitor Monitoring: Stay within 5% of competitors while maintaining your premium position\n‚Ä¢ Volume Discounts: Implement tiered pricing with 3%, 5%, and 8% discounts at different volume thresholds\n\nWould you like me to generate a detailed implementation plan?",
